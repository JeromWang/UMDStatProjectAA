Text embedding methods at different levels for tweets text classification
To test my implementation, go to MyImplementation and download all the files
Run the AAc for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on character embedding, AAs for subword embedding, AAw for word embedding.

The Prasha's Implementation requires Keras==1.0 and theano backend to run. Make sure the dependencies are satisfied.
